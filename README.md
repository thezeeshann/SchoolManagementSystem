The  __School Management System__ has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system.
This software is supported to eliminate and sometimes reduce the hardships faced by this existing system.
Moreover, this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner.
In particular, this school management system project in Python Django focuses mainly on dealing with student-teacher records. Also, the system displays all the available dues amounts. In addition, the system allows managing attendance records. Evidently, this project is divided into three categories: Student, Teacher, and Admin Panel. In an overview of this web application, a student can simply register and start using it. Initially, this action requires approval from the admin. In fact, he/she has to apply for it. However, each application requires action from the administrator which depends upon their approval or disapproval. After confirmation of a studentâ€™s account, the user can view his/her details, public notice from admin and teachers. Besides, the student can view their own personal attendance record.
